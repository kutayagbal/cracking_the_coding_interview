	 * each stack, and then merge them back together in sorted order into the
	 * original stack. Note that this would require the creation of two additional
	 * stacks per level of recursion. With the quicksort solution, we would create
	 * two additional stacks and divide the stack into the two stacks based on a
	 * pivot element. The two stacks would be recursively sorted, and then merged
	 * back together into the original stack. Like the earlier solution, this one
	 * involves creating two additional stacks per level of recursion.
